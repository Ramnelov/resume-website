# Resume Website

Hello and wellcome to the repository for my resume website project! A frontend application utilizing [**SolidJS**](https://www.solidjs.com/) for coding, [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) for data management and [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) for hosting.

The website is meant to be used as a well styled resume available all around the world 24/7 and will be developed over time.

My goal is to explore web development further and experiment.

The website can be found at [**ramnelov.com**](https://www.ramnelov.com).

Se you around!
